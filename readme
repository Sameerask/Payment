Creating a RESTful Application 


#REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer 

#The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource (Any object/instances that are created as model can be treated as resources)
#A REST resource can be 
   a document or an image 
   a temporal service
   collection of other resources 
   any non virtual object
   
   The State of the resource at any particular time is known as resource representation
   
   resource representation consists of 
   data 
   metadata
   hypermedia links that can help the cleints in transition to next desired state
   
   
   #A REST API consists of assembly of interlinked resources.
   These set of resources are known as REST API Resource model
